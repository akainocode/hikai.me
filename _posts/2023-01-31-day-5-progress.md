Hi! We actually had 3 members live past Party Synergy, so we got to see a short amount of Limitless Synergy. Here's our operating knowledge of Limitless Synergy:

- There are two 90 degree tankbuster (?) tethers, one from an Omega-M clone and one from an Omega-F clone. 
- There is a Ranged LB3 from Omega-M, our theory is that it targets either the furthest or a random player. 
- Omega-M spawns with a shield and does what appears to be the equivalent of Paladin Wings, with Omega-F behind the wings. 
- Additionally, an Omega-M clone spawns with a shield, so our theory is that it will do a dynamo. 
- There is an Omega-F clone that appears to be directly across the Omega-M clone that spawned with the shield, so we are guessing that she is either going to have the scythe shoes or cast the plus shaped AoE. 

We only really got a very short clip of the beginning of Limitless Synergy, so hopefully we'll see more. 

Oh right, here's our prog point for the day: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmX9zYF3PCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmX9zYF3PCw)
