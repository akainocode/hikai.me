Hi! I know it's been a hot minute since I've done a site update - have been relatively busy recently, but I'll be back to updating regularly soon. 

I'll update on our furthest prog point - we saw Hello Patch.

We were memeing as a group about Hello Patch

We did not expect it to actually be Hello Patch.

Here's our day 11 prog point: [https://youtu.be/BbtAd8E4fN8](https://youtu.be/BbtAd8E4fN8)
