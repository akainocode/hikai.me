### Day 1.5

Heyo - today we were able to sneak in a short 2h raid night, a lot cleaner, we had another p1 enrage pull tonight (thank you hallowed ground) but this time we almost had all 8 going into the wave cannon phase :o.

As usual, here's the clip of our longest prog point: [https://clips.twitch.tv/SleepyTriumphantChowderDeIlluminati-VXb495lUQaDrahOD](https://clips.twitch.tv/SleepyTriumphantChowderDeIlluminati-VXb495lUQaDrahOD)
