Hi! Today we got to the end of Limitless Synergy, so here's our working theory for the full mechanic.

1) Everyone starts center to bait the ranged lb3 from an Omega-M clone. 

2) Tanks grab tethers from an Omega-M clone and an Omega-F clone and point them out away from each other, while the party dodges the ranged LB3. These tethers resolve to do large 90 degree cleaves as a Melee LB3 (tankbuster). 

3) An Omega-F clone then targets 3 players with Prey debuffs from a Caster LB3. 

4) These players then spread out, while an Omega-M clone from the wall with a shield casts Beyond Defense on a player, applying a Twice-come Ruin.

5) Afterwards, the Omega-M clone from the wall then targets another player with Pile Pitch, from O12S we believe it is a stack. At the same time, the flares go off. 

6) Then, the party gets hit by Cosmo Memory. 

That's roughly everything that we've seen before the Laser Shower raidwide goes out (We believe that it's the enrage.)
