### Phase 1

This phase consists of three primary mechanics, **Program Loop**, **Pantokrator**, and **Wave Cannon**

## Debuff Library

- First in Line
- Second in Line
- Third in Line
- Fourth in Line
- Looper

## Program Loop

Omega assigns **First in Line**, **Second in Line**, **Third in Line**, and **Fourth in Line** to two players per debuff. Additionally, all players get a **Looper** debuff with a duration of 15s, 22s, 33s, and 42s respectively. 
<!--- TODO: Add debuff icons to library --->

Next, two towers spawn around the arena along with two tethers originating from Omega. Each tower deals a moderate amount of damage and apply a stack of **Twice Come Ruin** that lasts 11s, and can only be soaked by a player with the **Looper** debuff. On the other hand, each tether creates an AoE that applies a 99% **HP Down** debuff along with a stack of **Twice Come Ruin** that also lasts 11s.  

Establish a 1-8 priority system in which if a player is higher on the list than their partner with the same set of debuffs, they go to the first tower clockwise from North. Alternatively, if the player is lower on the list than their partner, they go counter-clockwise from North-West. 

You start off at the end of the castbar with all players south, and have the two players with **Third in Line** be closest to the boss in order to grab the two tethers. Next, have the two players with **First In Line** go to their tower according to the established priority systemm around the outside of Omega's hitbox, while the two players with the tether stay inside Omega's hitbox until they can move to the edge of the arena while keeping in mind the following:
- Be distanced from the two towers that have spawned
- Be sufficiently distanced from eachother

At the same time, the players with **Second in Line** and **Fourth in Line** should be near the towers in order to avoid getting clipped by the AoEs from the players with the tether. 

After the first set of towers and tethers go off, the players with **Second in Line** move to the two new towers that have spawned, while the two players with **Fourth in Line** grab the tethers from the two players with **Third In Line**. 

<!--- TODO: Add examples --->

There is some nuance to the movement, so the players with the tethers should move to be on Omega's hitbox, while the players aiming to grab the tether should be inside Omega's hitbox. 

Next, you repeat the previous step with the players with **Third in Line** moving to the next two towers while the two players with **First in Line** grab the two tethers from the players with **Fourth in Line**

Finally, to resolve the mechanic you have the two players with **Fourth in Line** move to the two final towers while the two players with **Second in Line** grab the two tethers from the players with **First in Line**.
