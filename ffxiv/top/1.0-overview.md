### Overview  

# [P1: Beetle](../top/p1)

This phase is probably one of the hardest first phases in an ultimate that we've seen, mainly due to the full randomness within Program Loop and Pantokrator.

# [P2: Omega M and F](../top/p2)

This phase has two primary mechanics: Party Synergy and Limitless Synergy.

Party Synergy is a mechanic that takes a lot of just hopping in and getting used to, while Limitless Synergy is very intuitive.

# [P3: Final Omega](../top/p3)

HELLO PATCH.
