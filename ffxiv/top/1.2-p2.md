### Phase 2 

We have so far seen the entirety of **Party Formation** and we have seen the initial portion of Limitless Synergy. (Toolboxes and Arena Images will be added later.)

- [Arena Image]

## Debuff Library

- Packet Filter M ![packet filter m]
- Packet Filter F ![packet filter f]
- Mid Glitch ![mid glitch]
- Remote Glitch ![remote glitch]
- Magic Vulnerability Up ![magic vuln]
- Vulnerability Up ![vulnerability up]

## Marker Library

- Square ![square marker small]
- Circle ![circle marker small]
- Triangle ![triangle marker small]
- Cross ![cross marker small]

## Start

Omega-M and Omega-F start by casting **Firewall**, assigning the 4 closest players **Packet Filter F** ![packet filter f] and **Packet Filter M** ![packet filter m] respectively. Once players receive these debuffs, players with **Packet Filter M** ![packet filter m] can only damage Omega-F and players with **Packet Filter F** ![packet filter f] can only damage Omega-M.

After this, the bosses both then target the highest in aggro with **Solar Ray**, a circular tankbuster.

Omega-F and Omega-M then cast **Party Synergy**.

## Party Synergy

Once the bosses disappear, players get tethered to eachother with various playstation markers:

- Cross [cross marker]
- Square [square marker]
- Triangle [triangle marker] 
- Circle [circle marker]

These tethers are either **Mid Glitch** ![mid glitch] or **Remote Glitch** ![remote glitch] tethers. **Mid Glitch** ![mid glitch] requires the tethered players to be not too close and not too far apart, while **Remote Glitch** ![remote glitch] requires the tethered players to be far from eachother. Examples of the rough distance will be shown later. (One thing to note, players only need to be at the suitable distance when taking damage, you can ignore the **Vulnerability Up** ![vulnerability up] outside of that.)  

Then, two Omega-M and Omega-F clones spawn. You want to ignore the Omega-M clone in the center of the arena and identify the weapon that the remaining Omega-M clone holds. If Omega-M is holding a shield, his AoE will be a dynamo (donut), and if Omega-M is only holding a sword, his AoE will be a chariot (get out). Next, identify the Omega-F clone opposite of the previously identified Omega-M clone. If she has scythes from her shoes, Omega-F will do a Hot Wing (two 180 degree cleaves to her sides), otherwise she will do a plus shaped AoE towards her cardinals (AoE going through her North/South and East/West). All of the possible formations will be shown as follows, and our assumption is that they can be rotated to be at any cardinals/intercardinals.(images to be added soon)

- Sword / No Scythe 
- Sword / Scythe
- Shield / No Scythe
- Shield / Scythe

While moving to the safe spot, identify where the eye is. Using the eye as relative North, move to either side of the eye depending on a previously assigned priority system.

For **Mid Glitch** ![mid glitch], players need to be positioned as follows: [mid glitch spread positioning]

On the other hand, for **Remote Glitch** ![remote glitch], players need to be positioned as follows: [remote glitch spread positioning]

Once players are spread, Omega-F casts Optimized Fire III and places AoEs on every player that apply a **Magic Vulnerability Up** ![magic vuln]. 

Then, additional Omega-M clones spawn such that 4 take up either all cardinal or intercardinal spots, along with an additional one covering one of the 4 remaining clock spots. At the same time, Omega-F spawns in the center and begins to cast a knock back, along with stack markers appearing on two players. (We aren't 100% on the spawning rules for the stacks, so I will be operating under the assumption that it is fully random.)

Then, using the side with 3 Omega-M clones as relative North, have the group that was previously to the relative West of the Eye get knocked back to the West safe spot. If the tether is **Remote Glitch** ![remote glitch], have the East group get knocked towards the East safe spot. Otherwise, if the tether is **Mid Glitch** ![mid glitch], have the East group get knocked to the South safe spot. 

There is a slight adjustment that may need to be made depending on where the two stack markers show up. If the two stacks are on the same side, have one tether group swap according to a previously assigned priority. This is what my group uses,  with the first in the list crossing over:   
![cross marker small] ![circle marker small] ![triangle marker small] ![square marker small]

Once you get knocked back, the two stacks, **Discharger**, resolve and apply a **Magic Vulnerability Up** ![magic vuln]. After this, the two bosses spawn for a short uptime phase into **Limitless Formation**. 

## Limitless Formation

(We have seen what appear to be two tankbuster tethers, along with Omega-M casting Ranged LB3 at what appears to be a snapshot of someone in the middle.)
