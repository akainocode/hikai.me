### Phase 2 

We have so far seen the entirety of **Party Formation** and we have seen Omega-F cast **Limitless Formation**.

## Debuff Library

- Packet Filter M ![packet filter m]
- Packet Filter F ![packet filter f]
- Mid Glitch ![mid glitch]
- Remote Glitch ![remote glitch]
- Magic Vulnerability Up ![magic vuln]

## Start

Omega-M and Omega-F start by casting **Firewall**, assigning the 4 closest players **Packet Filter F** ![packet filter f] and **Packet Filter M** ![packet filter m] respectively. Once players receive these debuffs, players with **Packet Filter M** ![packet filter m] can only damage Omega-F and players with **Packet Filter F** ![packet filter f] can only damage Omega-M.

After this, the bosses then target the highest in aggro with **Solar Ray**, a circular tankbuster. 

The bosses then cast **Party Formation**.

## Party Formation

(To be revised once we cleanly get through the mechanic)

## Limitless Formation

(We have seen this castbar, but we have not seen it resolve)
